Molecule Vagrant is designed to allow use of Vagrant for provisioning of test
resources.

Supported Platforms
===================

This driver relies on vagrant command line which is known to be problematic
to install on several platforms. We do our best to perform CI/CD testing on
multiple platforms but some are disabled due to known bugs.

* ✅ MacOS with VirtualBox - GitHub Actions
* ✅ Fedora 32 with libvirt - Zuul
* ❌ CentOS 8 with libvirt - Zuul DISABLED due to 1127_ and 11020_

Please **do not file bugs for unsupported platforms**. You are welcomed to
create PRs that fix untested platform, as long they do not break existing ones.

.. _`11020`: https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues/11020


Documentation
=============

To use this plugin, you'll need to set the ``driver`` and ``platform``
variables in your ``molecule.yml``. Here's a simple example using the
`fedora/32-cloud-base`_ box:

.. code-block:: yaml

   driver:
     name: vagrant

   platforms:
     - name: instance
       box: fedora/32-cloud-base
       memory: 512
       cpus: 1

Here's a full example with the libvirt provider:

.. code-block:: yaml

   driver:
     name: vagrant
     provider:
       # Can be any supported provider (VBox, Parallels, libvirt, etc)
       name: libvirt

   platforms:
     - name: instance
       # List of dictionaries mapped to `config.vm.network`
       interfaces:
         # `network_name` is the required identifier, all other keys map to
         # arguments.
         - network_name: forwarded_port
           guest: 80
           host: 8080
       # List of raw Vagrant `config` options
       instance_raw_config_args:
         - 'vagrant.plugins = ["vagrant-libvirt"]'
       # Dictionary of `config` options. Note that string values need to be
       # explicitly enclosed in quotes.
       config_options:
         ssh.keep_alive: yes
         ssh.remote_user: "'vagrant'"
       box: fedora/32-cloud-base
       box_version: 32.20200422.0
       box_url:
       memory: 512
       cpus: 1
       # Dictionary of options passed to the provider
       provider_options:
         video_type: "'vga'"
       # List of raw provider options
       provider_raw_config_args:
         - "cpuset = '1-4,^3,6'"
       provision: no
